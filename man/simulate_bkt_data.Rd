\usage{
simulate_bkt_data(
  prior,
  guess,
  slip,
  learn,
  num_students,
  min_questions,
  max_questions,
  output_file = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{prior}{Numeric. Initial probability that a student has mastered the skill before any questions.
Corresponds to the BKT parameter \(P_p\).}

\item{guess}{Numeric. Probability that a student answers correctly despite not mastering the skill.
Corresponds to the BKT parameter \(P_g\).}

\item{slip}{Numeric. Probability that a student answers incorrectly despite mastering the skill.
Corresponds to the BKT parameter \(P_s\).}

\item{learn}{Numeric. Probability that a student transitions from the unmastered to mastered state after each activity.
Corresponds to the BKT parameter \(P_l\).}

\item{num_students}{Integer. Number of students to simulate.}

\item{min_questions}{Integer. Minimum number of questions (activities) per student.}

\item{max_questions}{Integer. Maximum number of questions (activities) per student.
Each student's actual sequence length is randomly drawn from 1 to \code{max_questions}.}

\item{output_file}{Character. Optional file path. If provided, the generated dataset will be written to a CSV file.}
}
\value{
A data frame with the following columns:
\itemize{
\item \code{order_id}: Integer, the order of the question within a student's sequence.
\item \code{correct}: Binary (0/1), indicating whether the student answered correctly.
\item \code{student_id}: Integer, the unique identifier for each student.
\item \code{skill_name}: Character, the skill associated with the responses (currently fixed as "mathematic").
}
}
\description{
This function generates simulated student response data based on the BKT model.
Each student is modeled as having a latent skill mastery state that can evolve over a sequence of
activities according to specified learning, guessing, and slipping probabilities.
The generated dataset can be used for testing, model evaluation, or demonstration purposes.
}
\details{
The simulated responses follow the standard BKT transition logic:
\deqn{P(K_{t+1} = 1) = P(K_t = 1) + (1 - P(K_t = 1)) \times P_l}
and the observed correctness is drawn as:
\deqn{P(C_t = 1) = P(K_t = 1)(1 - P_s) + (1 - P(K_t = 1))P_g.}
